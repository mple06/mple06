Hi, I'm Minhvan. I am a former project manager turned full stack web developer. I recently earned my certicate in Coding at the University of Washington. I'm fascinated by the world of technology and what it can do. I think the possibilities are endless. So I'm turning that fascination in reality and pursuing a career in coding. 

Some of my other interests are running, volleyball, and video games. If you would like to connect, please feel free to reach out.
