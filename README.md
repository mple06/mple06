Hi, I'm Minhvan. I am a former project manager turned web developer. I'm currently studying coding at the University of Washington. I'm fascinated by the world of technology and what it can do. I think the possibilities are endless.

Some of my interests are running, volleyball, and games. I'm open to any opportunities once I finish my course at UW - December 2021. Let's connect!
